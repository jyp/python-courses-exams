* Conic Sections

A conic section (or conic, or quadratic curve) is a curve obtained
from a cone's surface intersecting a plane. The three types of conic
section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse; the circle
is a special case of the ellipse. The hyperbola is sometimes
rectangular.

The general equation for a conic section is:

Ax²+Bxy+Cy²+Dx+Ey+F=0

Let Δ = B²-4AC

- if Δ < 0, the equation represents an ellipse;
     - if A = C and B = 0, the equation represents a circle, which is a special case of an ellipse;
- if Δ = 0, the equation represents a parabola;
- if Δ > 0, the equation represents a hyperbola;
   - if A + C = 0, the equation represents a rectangular hyperbola.


Write a function ~conic()~ that *inputs* the values of ~A~, ~B~ and ~C~
and determines which case applies, and prints it.

Example run:

#+begin_src python
>>> conic()
input A: 1
input B: 0
input C: 1
The function represents a circle

>>> conic()
input A: 3
input B: 0
input C: 2
The function represents an ellipse

>>> conic()
input A: 1
input B: 2
input C: -3
The function represents a hyperbola
