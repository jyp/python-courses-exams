* General information
For each question, paste your solution in the text field under the
description.

- All answers should be provided as working Python code
- You should perform your own tests to verify that the code is
  correct. However test cases need not be provided with your
  answer. If you do provide test cases, you should identify those
  clearly (for example with comments).
- For maximum credits, the provided answer should be in the best
  possible complexity class. Less efficient answers will be given
  partial credits.
- It is not necessary to comment on your code, it is more important
  that the code is clean and easy to read. It is good to use comments
  to document assumptions that you make, if any.

*For a 2-question exam:*

The maximum possible total number of points
is 35. 14 points correspond to grade 3, 21 points correspond to grade
4, and 28 points correspond to grade 5.

*For a 3-question exam.*

The maximum possible total number of points is 60.  24 points
correspond to grade 3, 36 points correspond to grade 4, and 48 points
correspond to grade 5.


*Allowed aids:*
  - You can refer to your 1-page of handwritten notes.
  - You can use the Self-Practice website in sandbox mode to test your
    code. From the Safe Exam Browser, you should click the "Python
    Sandbox" button on the bottom left of your screen to open it. This
    will open the self-practice website that we used in the course in
    another window.  Note that your code won't be
    saved if you close or reload its window. Therefore it is advised to leave the
    Self-Practice window open and switch between
    windows using Alt+Tab or Option+Tab.

  - You can refer to the "python reference" resource on inspera.
  # - Questions are provided in Swedish for convenience, but in case of
  #   discrepancy the English version applies. You can use the
  #   (so-called "hamburger") menu to choose the language of questions.

*Disallowed aids:* anything else. In particular, it is not allowed to use the following electronic tools.
  - AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Llama, ...)
  - Communication tools (phone, chat, mail, social media, ...)
  - Electronic documentation (Google, stack overflow, python guides or manuals, ...)
  - Books
  - Notes in printed or electronic format

** Results and Exam Review (Granskning)

As soon as the exam grading is complete (about one week after the exam
date), you'll be able to access your graded copy from Inspera. You
will be able to consult standard solutions for the exam at the usual
place: =https://github.com/jyp/python-courses-exams=
# NOTE: it is critical that this is not a clickable link otherwise the students can follow it (and then get locked out of inspera.)

If you believe that a mistake happened when grading your submission,
you can come to the exam review ('granskning'), which will take place

- Date: June 23rd
- Time: 10 to 11am
- Location: SB-L113

Before you arrive, *prepare*:

  1. The specific question or sub-question which you believe was
     handled incorrectly.
  2. Your explanation of why your submission is actually correct.
  3. Your anonymous code used on Inspera.

Note: the purpose is of exam review is not to discuss the grading
scale or difficulty level of the exam, but only to clear potential
errors in grading.
