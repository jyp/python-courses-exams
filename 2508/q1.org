* Confidence Interval

The bounds of a confidence interval CI are given by the formula:

  \(CI = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)

where
- \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean
- \(z\) is the confidence level value (e.g., for a 95% confidence interval, z â‰ˆ 1.96)
- \(s\) is the sample standard deviation 
- \(n\) is the sample size

Define a function ~ci~ which takes each of the above as parameters in the given order,
and prints the bounds of the confidence interval, or prints an error if
the sample size is zero or negative.

Here are example runs:
#+begin_example
>>> ci(100,1.96,10,5)
interval: [91.23461352820082, 108.76538647179918]

>>> ci(100,1.645,10,0)
Error: empty sample
#+end_example
