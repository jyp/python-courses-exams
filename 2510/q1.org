* Poisson distribution

The Poisson probability mass function distribution with parameter λ>0 is given by the following equation:

$\displaystyle f(k;\lambda )={\frac {\lambda ^{k}e^{-\lambda }}{k!}}$

where

- λ is a positive real number
- k is the number of occurrences (k = 0, 1, 2, …)
- e is Euler's number (e = 2.71828…)
- k! = k(k-1) ··· (3)(2)(1) is the factorial.

Tasks:

a) Write a function ~poisson(k,lam)~ which computes the above formula (5 points)
b) Write a function ~main()~ which does the following: (10 points)
    - input a value for k
    - input a value for λ
    - check that the inputs are valid, and:
      - if they are, print the probability mass
      - if not, print the error message: "invalid parameters"

Hint: the factorial can be computed using the function ~factorial~ from the ~math~ module.
